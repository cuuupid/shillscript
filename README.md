#Shillscript (also known as Powershill)

Hillary Clinton Programming Language :)

##Installation and Usage

###Installation
To install, you just need clinton.py in the same directory as your files or in the working path.
There are other files provided here. 
- backup.py in case you run
```bash
python clinton.py clinton.py
```
Which could have very disastrous results.
- helloworld.benghazi for sample code
- backup.benghazi if you accidentally delete helloworld.benghazi

###Usage
To run code:
```
python clinton.py filename.benghazi
```
Where filename.benghazi is your script. It's that simple!


##Rules
###Basic rules:
- All filenames must end in .benghazi
- All scripts must start by declaring itself as a female and saying it will make history
```
I will make history as the first female president
```

###Output
To print statements, you must first
```
teleprompter prompt "hello world"
hillary read from teleprompter
```

###Email
You can email in this format
```
**email message $ to_address@example.com #Subject here
```
And run this command in a separate terminal window:
```
python email_server_init.py
```
Then run your code in a separate terminal window:
```
python clinton.py helloworld.benghazi
```
It (probably) won't actually send the email but it shows up in the email server window.

###Replacements
To make up for the fact that if/then isn't supported you can use
```
hillary repeat
```
to repeat the last command. You can't do this more than once because Madame Secretary only repeats herself once.

###Exclusions
Variables are not supported because you're not allowed to save anything.
Objects are not supported because Madame Secretary only takes money from Wall Street.
if/then are not supported because Madame Secretary doesn't need to consider anything or anyone else when making decisions.
